# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**QuantumLayer** is a conceptual project repository containing strategic documentation for CodeMind, an AI-powered cognitive software factory. This repository currently contains business planning and technical architecture documentation rather than actual implementation code.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains strategic documentation and blueprints:

- `codemind-startup-blueprint.md` - Comprehensive startup blueprint including technical architecture, business model, implementation roadmap, competitive analysis, and funding strategy
- `codemind-executive-summary.md` - Executive summary of the CodeMind vision and business opportunity
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code configuration with permissions

## Project Vision

The repository documents the vision for **CodeMind: The World's First Cognitive Software Factory** - an AI system that understands business intent and autonomously builds, deploys, and evolves complete software ecosystems.

### Key Innovations Documented

1. **Business Intent Engine** - Understands business models, not just code requirements
2. **Living Software** - Applications that evolve automatically based on business metrics
3. **Proof-of-Business System** - Mathematical verification that software achieves business goals
4. **Zero-Shot Enterprise Deployment** - From idea to production in minutes

## Technical Architecture (Planned)

The documented architecture includes:

- **Custom Orchestrator** - Proprietary orchestration logic optimized for business-to-code generation
- **Multi-Agent System** - Planning, Architecture, Code, and Testing agents working in coordination
- **Neurosymbolic Core** - Combines neural generation with symbolic reasoning and formal verification
- **Business Intent Engine** - Industry knowledge graph with 10,000+ business models

### Technology Stack (Documented Plan)

- **Core Languages**: Python (orchestration), Rust (performance), TypeScript (generated frontend)
- **AI/ML**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Claude Haiku
- **Infrastructure**: Multi-cloud (AWS primary, GCP backup), Kubernetes, Docker
- **Verification**: Z3 theorem prover, Isabelle proof assistant

## Development Approach (When Implementing)

Based on the documentation, the planned development approach includes:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-8)
- MVP architecture with simple business intent parsing
- Template-based generation with LLM customization
- Basic multi-agent collaboration

### Phase 2: MVP Launch (Weeks 9-16)
- Advanced business understanding with industry knowledge graph
- Self-healing system v1
- Enterprise features and compliance

### Phase 3: Scale & Investment (Months 5-8)
- Living software engine with automatic evolution
- Proof-of-business system with formal verification
- Enterprise integration capabilities

## Business Model

The documented business model includes:
- Subscription tiers from $99/month (Starter) to $19,999/month (White Label)
- Equity partnership model for startups (3-5% equity for MVP development)
- Target markets: Solo entrepreneurs, small businesses, enterprises, consultancies

## Important Notes

- This repository currently contains **documentation and planning materials only**
- No actual implementation code exists yet
- The documents represent a comprehensive blueprint for building the CodeMind platform
- Focus on business strategy, technical architecture planning, and market analysis

## Current State

This is a **pre-implementation** repository containing strategic planning documents. Any development work should start with the MVP architecture outlined in the startup blueprint, beginning with:

1. Basic business intent parsing
2. Template-based app generation
3. LLM integration for customization
4. Simple deployment pipeline

## File Analysis Notes

- All existing files are markdown documentation
- No package managers or build systems currently configured
- No source code present
- Repository represents the conceptual and strategic foundation for future development
